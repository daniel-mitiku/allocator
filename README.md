## Overview

A comprehensive university scheduling system that enables multiple colleges to manage their own courses, personnel, rooms, and programs while generating optimized timetables. The system features role-based access control, historical assignment tracking, and multiple allocation algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Multi-College Architecture**: Each college manages its own resources independently
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Super Admin and College Admin roles with appropriate permissions
- **Three Allocation Methods**: Backend Python solver, Google Colab integration, and in-UI manual allocation
- **Timeslot Preference Ranking**: Drag-and-drop interface for ranking preferred time slots
- **Historical Assignment Tracking**: Complete records of personnel-course assignments across scheduling instances
- **Enhanced Allocation Algorithm**: Considers historical data and preferences for optimal assignments

## Development Status: In Progress

**Current Status**: Core architecture implemented, integration and testing phase required.
